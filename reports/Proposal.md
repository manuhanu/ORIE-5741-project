## Background
The traditional finance theories, such as CAPM, Fama-French models, have laid the foundations for predicting the Traditional finance theories like CAPM and Fama-French model have laid the foundations for forecasting asset prices. Multi-factor models like these are essentially supervised learning problems - given a set of features, what will be the return of an asset at some future point in time? Will it go up, or down? 

We want to see if multi-factor models can be used to predict the price of Bitcoin. This question is concerned by lots of investors of crypto including giant prop-trading firm like Jane Street and private investors. However, predicting the price of Bitcoin has more challenges: Higher volatility, 24/7 trading, and no fundamental factors (e.g. P/E ratio, Free Cash Flow to Equity). However, these challenges are what make this problem interesting. We divide the factors of Bitcoin into three categories: Technical factors (momentum, moving averages, and Bitcoin order flow), Fundamental factors (Gold price, Hash rate, GPU price, and returns of technology stocks (or some other basket of equities)), and Sentimental factors (Google trend of Bitcoin). There is much empirical evidence showing that using such factors could make better prediction on crypto

Our final goal is to combine these features and machine learning techniques to predict the price of Bitcoin at some future time/date and make appropriate trading decisions based on our model.


## Data
Our Bitcoin daily price and volume data ranging from 01/01/2015 from 09/30/2021 could be obtained from "https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BTC-USD". The data include open, close, high, low price and volume. We are exploring other data sources that are granier, perhaps intra minute or even tick level data.

Our features are seperated into 3 categories:
1. Technical factors: Technical factors including but not limited to momentum factors (e.g. RSI), trend factors (e.g. MA) are generated by the price and volume data of Bitcoin.
2. Fundamental factors:   
    (a) Gold price: It is assumed that gold price is similar to Bitcoin price since both of them have a finite amount of supply. Data Source: "https://goldprice.org/".  
    (b) Hashrate: Hashrate is a measure of the computational power when mining. High hashrate increased the security of Bitcoin network, leading to the higher coin price. Data Souce: "https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_network_hash_rate".  
    (c) GPU price: GPU price have great influence on the supply of Bitcoin because GPU is vital during the mining process. Data source: "https://pcpartpicker.com/trends/price/video-card/".   
    (d) Returns of technology stocks: Bitcoin is greatly related to the technology companies such as Facebook, Microstrategy. So we assume that their stock price have some relationships with Bitcoin. The data could be obtained from Yahoo Finance.
3. Sentimental factors:  
    (a) Google trend of Bitcoin: We assume that if goolge trend is high, which means much more people are paying attention to Bitcoin, the Bitcoin might have some break news (e.g. drastic price change). Data Source: "https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?q=Bitcoin"


## Methods
We are interested in both regression methods and classification methods (to predict the Bitcoin price whether to go up or down). Firstly, we will try feature engineering methods to transform the features according to their characteristics. Secondly, for the regression methods, we will try linear regression, ridge and lasso regression, etc. As for the classification methods, we will try logistic regression and SVM first, and then proceed to tree-based models.
